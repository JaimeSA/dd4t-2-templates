================================
Changes in behaviour since version 1.31:
================================

1. ResolveWidthAndHeight is now true unless explicitly set to false in a parameter (used to be false by default)
2. Changed type of Multimedia.Size from int to long (because Tridion has also changed the type of the corresponding property)
3. Page templates can now follow links to components and resolve binary widht/height if you set the correct parameters (similarly to component templates)



================================
Migration scenarios
================================
======= DD4T 1.* -> 2.0 ========
All DD4T 2 templates are fully backwards compatible with a DD4T 1 web application. Just leave the 'Serialization format' and 'Compress output' settings empty (or set Serialization format to 'XML').

This allows you to upgrade the templates first, and the web application later (or not at all).


========= JSON and XML =========
1. The first TBB in a template dictates the format (if TBB 1 specifies JSON and TBB specifies XML, the output is JSON).
2. PT dictates the format for static component presentations (if the CT specifies JSON and the PT specifies XML, the output is XML)
Note: if the CT is set to 'publish as a dynamic component', the CT dictates its own format!

However, we recommend to pick 1 format and stick by it.
